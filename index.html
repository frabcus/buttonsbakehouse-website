<p class="lead">I have been baking since my grandma bought me a recipe book at a playgroup book sale when I was 4. I made chocolate brownies with her and still use the same recipe 26 years later! </p>

<p class="lead">I am a passionate baker and love to try to recipes and flavours. I aim to pass on my knowledge and enthusiasm by delivering children's baking parties. </p>

<p class="lead">My goal is to produce high quality, home-made goods for everyone to enjoy.</p>

<p class="lead">I have a level 2 food hygiene certificate and was awarded a grade 5 for my food hygiene practices. </p>

<p class="lead">Happy cake munching,</p>
